- proposal that passed but cannot execute without recordAI function
https://www.tally.xyz/gov/daao-base/proposal/11141335929866216605553773698272746369487152417525508155983759260517915090325

# About AI Recorder

to execute proposal it should be recorded by recordAI function in Daao.sol
Third party or program like chainlink functions could run AI model and trigger this function.

* owner could be changed as AA wallet or Colud change onlyOwner as onlySigner if neccesarry in this case but we used ownable here to show basic cases.

```
    function recordAI(
        uint256 _proposalId,
        string memory _uri,
        bytes memory _prompt,
        bool isPassed
    )
        public onlyOwner
    {
        AIDatas[_proposalId].positivePassed = isPassed;
        AIDatas[_proposalId].uri = _uri;
        AIDatas[_proposalId].prompt = _prompt;
    }
```

it could be checked from checkAI and checkAIPass in Daao.sol

```
    function checkAI(
        uint256 _proposalId
    ) public view returns (AIData memory){
        return AIDatas[_proposalId];
    }

    function checkAIPass(
        uint256 _proposalId
    ) public view returns (bool){
        return AIDatas[_proposalId].positivePassed;
    }
```

This function is motivated from eip 7007 and used could be the same as erc 7007 difference is just 7007 used nft and Daao didn't make checkLogic in NFT format

https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7007

```
    function mint(
        address to,
        bytes calldata prompt,
        bytes calldata aigcData,
        string calldata uri,
        bytes calldata proof
    ) external returns (uint256 tokenId);

    /**
     * @dev Verify the `prompt`, `aigcData`, and `proof`.
     */
    function verify(
        bytes calldata prompt,
        bytes calldata aigcData,
        bytes calldata proof
    ) external view returns (bool success);
```
